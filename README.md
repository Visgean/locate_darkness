# Locate darkness

I edit my photos using DarkTable and a lot of times I do very basic editing such as saturation, cropping and 
perspective changes. And I don't want to keep the original files because they just take way too much space.

So this script finds all pictures that have already been edited and exported from darktable and moves them 
to new directory. It is very simple but it saves me some time and space.
